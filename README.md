# ninTrenDo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of *ninTrenDo* is to perform long-term high frequency Google
Trends queries by overlapping. This package let you to reconstruct
Google Trends high frequency data for extended periods. Using
overlapping windows and letting for long-term trend correction, this
package allows the search for any single query of daily, weekly, monthly
or quarterly frequency, covering longer periods than those allowed by
Google Trends direct search.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ninTrenDo from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ninTrenDo")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ssaninre22/ninTrenDo")
```

## Example

These are two basic examples which show you how to use this packageâ€™s
functions in order to obtain Google Trends high frequency data. The
first example shows how to obtain daily data for the word **hotel** in
Colombia (CO) during the period January 1st, 2014 until April 16, 2021.

``` r
library(ninTrenDo)
## basic example code
res <- long_gt(keyword = "hotel",geo="CO",
                 input.sdate = as.Date("2014-01-01"),
                 input.edate = as.Date("2021-04-16"),
                 input.frequency = "d",input.delta = 6,
                 input.ol.win = 1,input.type="web",input.categ=0)
#> [1] "GT sample = 1/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 2/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 3/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 4/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 5/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 6/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 7/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 8/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 9/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 10/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 11/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 12/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 13/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 14/15"
#> [1] "GT sample = 15/15"

res$plot
```

The second example conducts the same query but it corrects the output by
using long-term search index by using temporal dissagregation of monthly
data based on the daily long-term index built by overlapping windows.

``` r
library(ninTrenDo)
## basic example code
res <- long_gt_ltc(keyword = "hotel",geo="CO",
                 input.sdate = as.Date("2014-01-01"),
                 input.edate = as.Date("2021-05-01"),
                 input.frequency = "d",td.method="chow-lin",
                 input.delta = 5,
                 input.ol.win = 1)
#> [1] "GT sample = 1/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 2/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 3/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 4/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 5/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 6/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 7/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 8/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 9/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 10/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 11/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 12/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 13/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 14/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 15/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 16/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 17/18"
#> [1] "GT sample = 18/18"
#> [1] "Correction with monthly trend in process - Method: chow-lin"
