Description: Reconstruct Google Trends high frequency data for extended periods. Using
             overlapping windows and letting for long-term trend correction, this 
             package allows the search for any single query of daily, weekly, monthly
             or quarterly frequency, covering longer periods than those allowed by 
             Google Trends direct search.
